			<!-- Information about 67-373 Course -->
			<h1 id=homeTitle> 67-373: Information Systems Consulting Project Course</h1>
			<div id='text'>
				<p>In the Software Development Project course, small student teams collaborate with community-based organizations to develop useful information system solutions to meet real management needs. Each project team proposes, defines, designs and implements a working information system or application with the project client. Teams act as consultants working 'with' and not 'for' their project clients. At the completion of the project, each team must provide a sustainable solution that fits the client's objectives, organization constraints and capabilities.
				<br>
				<br>
				Real world client partnerships are an important part of the program's educational mission, giving students and project sponsors a significant opportunity to work together towards a common goal. For additional information please contact Professor Randy Weinberg, (412) 268-3228, or rweinberg@cmu.edu.</p>

                    &#10077 373 was an incredible opportunity to engage with a client, enter into a problem space, and then deliver a solution. It definitely gave me a sense of confidence in my ability to tackle real-world technological challenges. But more importantly, it solidified my belief that I can use my education to help make a difference for non-profit organizations across the country.&#10078

                    &#10077 373 challenged me both in the technical aspect, but mostly in the collaboration and client relations aspect. There were higher stakes in our project than usual class projects, but the impact of our solution for our client motivated my team to put worthwhile effort in. At the end of the semester, I can definitely say I was proud of the deliverable, but mostly the entire process that semester.&#10078

                    &#10077 67-373 follows a service-learning model, but student teams act as consultants working “with” and not “for” their clients. Students do not merely provide technical support or software development. Instead, they work in partnership with their clients to solve an organization problem with an IS solution.&#10078

                    &#10077 373 was the most useful and applicable course I took at CMU. It was a great learning experience in how to work as a team, and create a product for a real world client. It was also the most rewarding class I’ve ever taken because you really get to make difference by creating something for a Non-profit that does amazing work for our community. &#10078

                    &#10077 373 was an invaluable opportunity to get real-world consulting experience while working with a non-profit organization. It was a great experience in navigating organizational requirements and team based consultant work, and it really prepares students well for internships, where they are similarly faced with an unfamiliar organization and an unfamiliar problem to solve.&#10078
