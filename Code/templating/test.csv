Spring 2018,Web,Auberle,Suzi Rosati,"Our goal was to create a scheduling system that can be integrated through a responsive web application. The system would consolidate all children’s schedules into one system that can be updated by case specialists and admins, and accessed by case aides. Based on the children’s schedules and the planned trips for the case aides, the system would be able to notify employees of canceled trips, when help is needed, and when schedules are submitted for approval to the administrators. We created our solution using a Ruby on Rails application hosted on an IS department server, cmuisprojects.org, with a server provided by Auberle’s third party IT vendor (Ideal Integrations). The stakeholders for our application are the Foster Care Director, Ideal Integrations, the Director of Facilities and Operations, case specialists and aides, along with foster 31 families and childern. Our users are the Foster Care Directer - Suzi, case specialists, cae aides, and case managers.",Erin Dieringer,Matt Gruber,RhoEun Song,,images/AuberleLogo.png,s17/Auberle.pdf

Spring 2018,Mobile,Best of the Batch Foundation,Latasha Wilson-Batch,"The primary goal of this project was to rebuild and refactor the entire web application that previous IS teams had developed. After learning about the issues the client faced in previous years with usability and functionality, our goal became to create a web application that achieved a smooth registration process for Project C.H.U.C.K. and Next Level Athletics and to ensure the user interface / user experience of the application was well designed for both the admin and general user. We also envisioned that our system would support the easy addition of more programs as Best of the Batch grows and adds new programs to their repertoire.",Annette Chen,Akash Kejriwal,Jeremy Lee,,images/BestofBatchLogo.png,s17/BestofBatch.pdf
Spring 2018,Web,Blue Sky Fund,Paula Labieniec,"Through the Oppia platform, the team envisions an opportunity for Blue Sky Fund’s educators to create interactive online content to remedy time lost by unforeseen blockages on field trips. The Oppia interactions, both the existing ones and the new one the team customized based on the client’s course design, would provide quick and simple methods of creating innovative learning exercises for students. Students will have diversified learning experiences since not only they will have more opportunities to learn, but also will they learn at their own pace.",Jason Chen,Jordan Stapinski,Fang You,,images/BlueLogo.png,s17/BlueSkyFund.pdf
Spring 2018,Web,Handprinter.org,Gregory Norris,"Our team’s project vision is to build a seamless crowd-sourcing platform that allows submission of action ideas and includes a model generation interface that allows expert users to create a report detailing the description, variables, equation and documentation for an action idea. The primary users of our proposed project are both environmentally-conscious users as well highly-skilled individuals with necessary backgrounds in life cycle assessment and sustainability.",Alex Frazier,Serene Gao,Meghana Valluri,,images/HandLogo.png,s17/handprinter.pdf
Spring 2018,Mobile,CMU Spring Carnival Committee,Amalia Martinez & Stephen Clark,"We propose to first robustly test the application models and fix the 6 high-priority GitHub issues that are bug and security related. We aim to use this as a fundamental version of the application that is stable and free of functional errors. The next step is to build a notification feature in conjunction with the existing features to alert the users under different situations. For SCC members, the notification feature alerts them when a note is posted to a member. For student users, the feature alerts them when a requested tool becomes available, when a watch shift is imminent, and when organization starts downtime.",Akshay Goradia,Bruce Lin,Rumby Wilson,,images/springLogo.png,s17/CMU_Carnival.pdf
Spring 2018,Web,Holocuast Center of Pittsburgh,Lauren Bairnsfather,"We proposed to create a CRM system that allows attendees to check-in with the center’s events and galleries, and a way for visitors to provide more information about their interests in the Holocaust Center through a follow-up email. From a visitor’s standpoint, they would be able to quickly enter their email, first name, and last name. After a visit, visitors would be sent a link to complete additional information such as age and what their specific interests are. This allows the center to view analytics of their visitors and events, such as popular times and days of the week, and demographic information about their visitors. From a staff member’s perspective, they will be able to upload a pre-registration sheet and their existing Mailchimp subscribers to quickly look-up previous visitors of the Holocaust Center and checking them in a few seconds. With this information stored digitally, the center will be able to pull tangible data in order to make decisions about events and appeal for funding.",Sid Malladi,Sarah Reyes-Franco,Emily Su,,images/HoloLogo.png,s17/holocaust.pdf
