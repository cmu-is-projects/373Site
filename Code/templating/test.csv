Spring 2017,Web App,Auberle,Suzi Rosati,"Our goal was to create a scheduling system that can be integrated through a responsive web application. The system would consolidate all children’s schedules into one system that can be updated by case specialists and admins, and accessed by case aides. Based on the children’s schedules and the planned trips for the case aides, the system would be able to notify employees of canceled trips, when help is needed, and when schedules are submitted for approval to the administrators. We created our solution using a Ruby on Rails application hosted on an IS department server, cmuisprojects.org, with a server provided by Auberle’s third party IT vendor (Ideal Integrations). The stakeholders for our application are the Foster Care Director, Ideal Integrations, the Director of Facilities and Operations, case specialists and aides, along with foster 31 families and childern. Our users are the Foster Care Directer - Suzi, case specialists, cae aides, and case managers.",Erin Dieringer,Matt Gruber,RhoEun Song,,images/Auberle.jpg,s17/Auberle.pdf
