Spring 2018,Web App,Auberle,Suzi Rosati,"Our goal was to create a scheduling system that can be integrated through a responsive web application. The system would consolidate all children’s schedules into one system that can be updated by case specialists and admins, and accessed by case aides. Based on the children’s schedules and the planned trips for the case aides, the system would be able to notify employees of canceled trips, when help is needed, and when schedules are submitted for approval to the administrators. We created our solution using a Ruby on Rails application hosted on an IS department server, cmuisprojects.org, with a server provided by Auberle’s third party IT vendor (Ideal Integrations). The stakeholders for our application are the Foster Care Director, Ideal Integrations, the Director of Facilities and Operations, case specialists and aides, along with foster 31 families and childern. Our users are the Foster Care Directer - Suzi, case specialists, cae aides, and case managers.",Erin Dieringer,Matt Gruber,RhoEun Song,,images/AuberleLogo.jpg,s17/Auberle.pdf
Spring 2018,Web App,Beaver County Humane Society,"Donna Bucek, Karen Dioguardi, Shannan O'Neill & Susan Salyards","Our vision for our project will be to enhance the overall product left by last years team, in order to identify lingering problems with their foster system setup.",Daniel Graf,Pooja Penninti,,,images/BeaverLogo.png,s17/BeaverHumaneSociety.pdf
Spring 2018,Web App,Best of the Batch Foundation,Latasha Wilson-Batch,"The primary goal of this project was to rebuild and refactor the entire web application that previous IS teams had developed. After learning about the issues the client faced in previous years with usability and functionality, our goal became to create a web application that achieved a smooth registration process for Project C.H.U.C.K. and Next Level Athletics and to ensure the user interface / user experience of the application was well designed for both the admin and general user. We also envisioned that our system would support the easy addition of more programs as Best of the Batch grows and adds new programs to their repertoire.",Annette Chen,Akash Kejriwal,Jeremy Lee,,images/BestofBatchLogo.png,s17/BestofBatch.pdf
Spring 2018,Website,Blue Sky Fund,Paula Labieniec,"Through the Oppia platform, the team envisions an opportunity for Blue Sky Fund’s educators to create interactive online content to remedy time lost by unforeseen blockages on field trips. The Oppia interactions, both the existing ones and the new one the team customized based on the client’s course design, would provide quick and simple methods of creating innovative learning exercises for students. Students will have diversified learning experiences since not only they will have more opportunities to learn, but also will they learn at their own pace.",Jason Chen,Jordan Stapinski,Fang You,,images/BlueLogo.png,s17/BlueSkyFund.pdf
Spring 2018,Web App,CMU Athletics,Christine Scalise,"Our vision is to implement a web application that will increase the reliability and efficiency of the equipment rental process. With the planned web application, CMU Athletics will be able to reliably track who rents out what equipment and when the equipment is rented out. This will allow the organization to ensure that the equipment is returned and customer rental information is tracked. The student employees working at the equipment desk will also be able to improve the efficiency in which equipment is checked out and checked in. This will be done by reducing the human input and automating much of the information tracked in the system.",James Jameson,Hyun Hee Clara Kim,Andrew Wang,,images/AthleticsLogo.jpg,s17/CMU_Athletics.pdf
Spring 2018,Web App,CMU Professional Development Services,"Kim Abel, Sarah Emory & Adam Marks","Our goal for this project was to build a robust, deployable, and scalable web application for Professional Development Services. Their new competency-centric initiative hinged on our application being deployed and usable. We began the project knowing a successful deployment was expected and adjusted our scope and feature set accordingly throughout the semester. Our biggest goals were a highly interactive assessment report and an intuitive admin-side for the application.

Spring 2018,Web App,CMU Spring Carnival Committee,Amalia Martinez & Stephen Clark,"We propose to first robustly test the application models and fix the 6 high-priority GitHub issues that are bug and security related. We aim to use this as a fundamental version of the application that is stable and free of functional errors. The next step is to build a notification feature in conjunction with the existing features to alert the users under different situations. For SCC members, the notification feature alerts them when a note is posted to a member. For student users, the feature alerts them when a requested tool becomes available, when a watch shift is imminent, and when organization starts downtime.",Akshay Goradia,Bruce Lin,Rumby Wilson,,images/springLogo.png,s17/CMU_Carnival.pdf
