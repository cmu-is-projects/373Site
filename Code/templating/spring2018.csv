Our proposed solution was to build on top of Kidlift̥s current Squarespace application, along with integrating a 3rd party scheduling application, AcuityScheduling. The top priorities for application functionality were customer onboarding, customer sign-in, scheduling, and payment. The functionality of AcuityScheduling covered these use cases, and Squarespace also has a plugin for Acuity which made integration straightforward. Both services have mobile-responsive solutions, which is suitable for the client and their customers, given their preference for a mobile-friendly solution. Using Acuity removes, or at least lessens, the burden of application maintenance on the client.",Chih-Sen (Jason) Chang,Youce (Andy) Ji,Svayam Mishra,,images/SP18-Logos/kidlift.jpg,s18/kidlift.pdfSpring 2018,Web,Kodiak Island Borough School District & NOAA Kodiak Lab,"Robert Foy, Damon Hargraves, Jennifer Newby","Taking advantage of this project opportunity, our team worked closely with the client to devise a solution in the form of a crowdsourcing game that would leverage the partnership between the school district and the Kodiak Lab.
